REMESH Seminar
========================
# Overview
Linguistic, visual, and audio information can now be decoded from brain activity with remarkable fidelity by the use of generative and foundational AI systems. In this seminar, attendees will gain a general background through practical implementations of machine learning techniques applied to electroencephalography (EEG) signals. First, we will focus on how neural signals can be decoded to understand cognition using classification-based decoding, a popular and understandable technique in the field. Second, we will explore how brain signal representations correlate with AI model representations using representational similarity analysis (RSA). Together, these results begin to shed light on the continuous decoding of multiple modalities unfolding in the human brain.
